- **FileName**: Name of the Lambda layer file.
- **Lambdafunctionname**: Name for the Lambda function.
- **pythonruntime**: Python runtime for the Lambda function.
- **vpcname**: Name for the VPC.
- **publicsubnetname**: Name for the public subnet.
- **privatesubnetname**: Name for the private subnet.
- **publicroute**: Name for the public route.
- **privateroute**: Name for the private route.
- **VpcCidrBlock**: CIDR block for the VPC.
